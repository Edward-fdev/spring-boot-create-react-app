__Initial setup of your machine:__
1. [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
2. Install watchman `brew update && brew install watchman`


__Setup project:__
1. Clone the repo with project name: `git clone https://github.com/thomasbem/spring-boot-create-react-app.git <project_name>`
2. `cd <project_name>`
3. Run gradle setup: `./setup.sh`


When using alternate front-end, run `yarn global add flow-typed`. When adding new modules to package.json, run `flow-typed install`.
This fetches flow type definitions for npm modules if they exist.
